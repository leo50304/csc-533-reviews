I did not finish at the salon until after 12:15... over 2 hours later with this manicure that did not even last me the rest of the day. It started chipping about 3 hours later. I got SNS and then waited over 30 minutes for this flame design which took 30 minutes to finish and had to ask someone to add a top coat to my manicure so I could leave and pay. Not at all worth my time or money, very disappointed. Would love to have some compensation for this as I am a returning customer.",

My roommate and I were displaced after the VG apartment fire and Azyn worked with us quickly and efficiently under these circumstances. She helped us get moved in within 48 hours and I am in love with the place. The apartment layout is unique and so cute with great amenities! Highly recommend this community!!",

Upon move in day, the place smelled like urine and I have outstanding maintenance requests from when I moved in that never got fixed. We had a broken oven for over a week and a half and could not cook. The appliances are outdated and half broken. The staff in management are extremely unprofessional and will speak down to you. They take advantage of the fact we are students and don\\u2019t read into small fine details. The communication is lacking to say the least. Today I got begged by the staff to leave them good reviews after being affected by the fires and the church donated items for us in need. VG tried saying they were handing the situation and doing as much as they could for us. It seems like the bare minimum to me. Do not recommend this community.",

So great to work with that we purchased 2 vehicles. Scott is a hidden gem! He made sure our transactions were smooth and easy. He went out of his way to help my daughter set up her phone blue tooth before driving off. Its the simple touches of customer service that make the difference. Chris was also amazing to work with. They have added a lifelong customer!",

The apartments are really run down and have cockroach infestation, the so-called amenities are basically non-existent or broken most of the time, the staff are rude and will do everything in their power to cheat you out of money even after you move out. They damaged their own property and charged me for it. I also recall having the accounts manager barge into my room to charge the previous resident with a non-existent stain two months after I had already been living there. Ridiculous.",

I was having some issues with roommates and was feeling unsafe. Once this was brought to the leasing teams attention, they worked with me to rectify the situation immediately. This really demonstrated that Village Green puts the health and safety of their residents first and foremost.\\nBrandon, the Community Manager, took time out of his day on several occasions to help resolve my problems, and put my wellbeing first, which shows me the kind of people working here. Along with that, maintenance is relatively quick with answering requests, and the furniture in the units is very nice. I would recommend to any upperclassmen looking for a place to live.",

Almost immediately upon arrival, my friend and I were treated with what I can only describe as downright meanness by an employee. She was rude, condescending, and even made fun of me in front of other customers for not understanding how the outdoor payment system works. In addition to that, she then went inside the store to continue to make rude remarks about me to other customers and coworkers. When you walk into a small used bookshop, you usually expect a friendly set of employees who have a love for books and reading. What I experienced here was the complete opposite. Please do NOT patronize this establishment, especially if you struggle with issues like social anxiety. Shocked and disappointed.",

I decided to take a look at some student housing in the area and to my surprise Village Green really stuck out to me in the best way. The location was perfect and the guy who gave me my tour was amazing!!! Upon arriving at the site I was meet by Kevin he was very personable and also very knowledgeable about all the questions that I had. Not only did he inform about the property and all the benefits that I would receive if I decided to stay there. He also highlight how amazing the RDU area is. He really showed everything in the best way. I plan on talking to my parents about staying here because with the help of Kevin he made me realize that this property is best suited for me.",

For that I\\u2019m forever grateful!\\n\\nIn my short time here I have loved the convinence of being near restaurants, shops, farmers market, nc state and more!

Bugs in floor and hair clips from previous occupants all over the floor. Laminate floor in kitchen area ripped up.  Laminate on cabinets peeling off and big water stain in ceiling. Pan below stove full of crumbs.  Shower had previous tenants hair still in the tub. Excrement still in the toilet where the toilet was not cleaned.  Not what we expected for our College student that we moved in today.  There are four students renting this apartment at $700+ a person.  I would expect more.  We can not recommend anyone use this complex in the future.",

The parts did not fix the problem or they found other issues.  Got call car was done.  Went to pick up and they did not have paperwork ready.  I was told he would email it to me.  Have not seen it yet (now one week from picking the car up).  He also told me he sent the car to be washed.  That was not done either.  The bad thing is the last time I had the car in they had it for over 30 days.  My warranty is up now so I will not take car back to them.",

I came back to my apartment and my room was cleaned out. The staff had thrown all my stuff away and no one in the office wanted to admit who was responsible. I was still well within my leasing period and I have never been late on a rent payment or violated any rules within my lease contract. I contacted the manager of the property who after multiple attempts to get in touch with him, stated that he would figure out what happened and call me back and he would work with me to make an agreement on what to do. He later just ignored my e-mails and I never heard back. Just do yourself a favor and choose somewhere else to live.",

I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve had a real complaint since the day my roommate and I moved in. They\\u2019d switched our apartment around the night before we were set to move in, but Brandon worked tirelessly on move-in day to fix the problem. The office staff are amazing and are always willing to work with you. They often have free food and do resident appreciation weeks.\\n\\nThe two-bedroom apartments are spacious, have a good amount of storage space, and they are working on putting in new furniture. Every maintenance request has always been taken care of in a timely manner, sometimes so quickly as to be surprising. Village Green is located very conveniently right off of I-440. It\\u2019s a ten minute straight shot to downtown, or ten minutes to NCSU\\u2019s main campus. As an NC State student, there really is no better location for the price. I\\u2019ve always known it to be a quiet complex and I have never felt unsafe.\\n\\nMy one, and only one, complaint is the lack of visitor parking. Most visitors end up parking in the regular spots anyway and it causes issues sometimes with residents having to park two or three buildings down from their own apartment.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this complex for students who don\\u2019t need \\u201cluxury\\u201d apartments. You really can\\u2019t beat it. I wish I could stay.",

The kids had an absolute blast, as did the adults. Amazing staff... very polite kids working on the hill and kind and accommodating admin personnel. Already cant wait to come back next winter! Oh, and so affordable too!! Thank you, thank you all!",

Unfortunately, at no fault of their own, they couldn\\u2019t get their hands on what he wanted. Knowing F250\\u2019s are hard to come by right now (COVID), Jeff never stopped trying! He stayed in constant communication and searched through all their networks. While we couldn\\u2019t close a deal this time, we will be back (again!) and continue to recommend this dealership.",

The staff is so friendly and caring regardless of how large or small the issue is. I never feel like Im rushed so they can get to their next patient. I had insurance questions and they brought their insurance biller into the room to help me right then.  Dr. Graham was so nice and reassuring with everything. I highly recommend them!",

Everyone was welcoming and friendly, the place was clean, and the show was great. Overall I would go back, but was disappointed in the food and drink options.\\n\\nA mobile bartending service was set up, but the drinks were crazy overpriced and options limited. $8 for a weak drink served in a small plastic punch cup (not a full size drink or even a single that you get at a normal bar), only 2 beer options (an IPA and Corona), and I recognized the wine option as a cheap bottle from Aldi (I\\u2019m curious what the per glass charge for wine was). They ran out of Corona 1/2 way through the show but did go out to get more.\\n\\nThe food options were limited (nachos, hot dogs, wings), nothing for vegetarians unless you order the plain nachos. Felt more like food you would find at a baseball game.",

The staff were warm and friendly, able to answer all of our questions, and the manager Brandon was welcoming and on-time to meet with us even after some last minute changes. My son is looking forward to moving in and Im comfortable and happy with his first apartment being here. Thanks to the staff for making this transition exciting, welcoming, and fun!",

They also, have a grand total of 18 visitor spots and 200 apartments... So if youre someone with no friends, this is just the place for you! I unfortunately lived in this GATED COMMUNITY(the gates never work) for a 12 month period. If there were an option for 0 stars, it would be more fitting, but in order to make this post, you have to at least put 1. However, I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. It has some of the worst staff and if you need assistance from maintenance, you might hear back from them within the week. I went without a washing machine for about two weeks before they could get the problem fixed. Not to mention the infestation of COCKROACHES that i dealt with on a weekly basis. They have a wonderful pool that might be open 3 weeks out of the summer due to their improper ways of enforcing their no glass policy. I moved out with all intentions of never seeing this place again but, OH NO! I just got an email threatening to send me to collections so I called back to ask what I had done. They billed me for an additional cleaning charge after I already cleaned my apartment. I told them that I had cleaned my room and asked they drop the charge. They said no, unless I had pictures to justify my case. Of all the places that I have lived in the past few years I have never had to take pictures to prove myself to be honest. Not to mention, you can find a lot nicer for the money. I paid $613 for my part in a 3 room apartment. Do yourself a service and stay away from this establishment.",

They have changed my overall view of Village Green. Far as the apartment goes, I mean you pay for what you get. The prices to stay here is by far one of the most affordable priced apartments that comes furnished and that is located near NC State campus. Not to mention you can save gas by riding the Village Green bus. The bus driver will make your bus riding experience a ride to remember. Maintenance is a plus. Most problems that are reported are taken care of within 24 Hours if not sooner. I have seen it for myself, where they followed up on the work that was completed to make sure everything was taken care of. If you have any problems, questions or concerns just address them to a staff member in the office and they will take care of you. If a staff member cant help you the office manager will.",

I had to come back again a week later with the extra documents they had told me to bring, and this time they again couldnt agree on what documents I needed. After discussing right in front of me how  customers dont understand and dont want to listen, one employee finally made me leave, so now I will have to come back a THIRD time. I have never seen less knowledgeable employees, and it is shameful to know that the state pays people like this to give out drivers licenses, when they dont even understand their own laws. Overall terrible and extremely frustrating experience, and hopefully management will hire employees who actually care to learn about their job and how to do it in the future.",

He then tells me that he only specializes in deep tissue massages. I was initially hesitant because I have not had the best experiences with deep tissue massages and end up leaving sore rather than relaxed.  But I figured I might as well since I was already there. I am so glad I decided to move forward with the massage. It was definitely deep pressure but it ended up being more relaxing than any deep tissue massage I have experienced. Avi knows what he is doing and I would highly recommend him. He was also very friendly and Im glad I got the chance to meet him. If youre in town, check out Avi!",

I had no choice but to move into a four bedroom since it was the only option left. Despite this mishap, Hailie took over my case and made an effort to get me moved into a three bedroom as soon as possible. She kept me updated on things as I waited and I could tell she wanted to make sure that I was comfortable with everything. It was a little under two weeks when I moved into the 3 bedroom and it worked in my favor to wait because I was the first person to move in and they added new carpet.",

I really like that it is a small community. My only issue is sometimes it is loud at night, we have some roach issues and living on the first floor you deal with people leaving dog poop outside your window which is pretty annoying. But those are issues you are going to have just about anywhere especially if you are on the first floor.",

My boyfriends car was towed from my apartment complex even though he thought he had a parking pass hanging. When we went to retrieve his car, one of the owners walked out with us and saw that the parking pass was indeed in the foot of his car flipped upside down. It was my boyfriends fault that he didnt have the pass visible, but Ace Towing gave us the car back for only 30% of the bill. This payed the driver who towed the car, but not the company. To me this was a very reasonable negotiation since the pass was not displayed.",

As a student, its proximity to campus is very convenient and the shuttle bus gets students back and forth in a timely manner. The rent is very affordable and the amenities are awesome. Maintenance is also quick to respond to any issues and do a great job. The only complaint I have is that the shuttle bus breaks down at inconvenient times.",

Through her communication (verbal and online - she communicates very well to Yelp messages) I can tell she is well read and extremely familiar in her field. She spoke to me about relevant studies and readings that directly related to my concerns about Lincoln.\\n\\nIm sure the other vet staff there is wonderful based on my experience with Dr. Teresa. The front desk was very welcoming and helpful as well.\\n\\nI will continue to bring Lincoln and highly recommend anyone looking for a new regular vet to seriously consider RCAH.",

Worst of all, it\\u2019s new management so they can\\u2019t help me at all. While speaking with management I was informed that they were just now doing their audit. 3 YEARS AFTER I HAD MOVED OUT!!! Whatever the previous management did or did not do is not my responsibility either! Whatever you do, do not stay here because they WILL hit you with hidden fees once you move out!!! Highly unprofessional!!!!",

The day I was signed up, I even asked several times if this was a non-contract binding month to month membership and I was told yes! Even before I signed the membership form the manager reassured me that it was in fact non-contract binding. I have to cancel the membership due to a family emergency and I was told by the billing company that I was told wrong and that it in fact was an 18 month membership contract. And now I\\u2019m probably going to have to pay the remaining amount left. DO NOT SIGN WITH THIS GYM! I WAS LIED TO!!!",

        "Review": "I lived in Village Green for about four years. I did not have any issues with Office Staff or Maintenance since Ms. Linda became property manager. The only concern I had was the gate issues maybe another type of gate system to be install to ensure that the gate doesnt keep getting messed up where it doesnt close at all and stay open all of the time. Other people have complain they maintenance is slow about things but that is only at the beginning or ending of leases when they are high volumes of people moving in and out at the same time where they are more service requests than normal and the maintenance can not resolve all the issues in one day so the residents have to be patience, but the office makes sure that it is resolve soon.\\n\\nThe location of the complex is in a great location, the shuttle to campus is convenient, the computer lab in the clubhouse is helpful because I didnt have to travel to campus to do things and the different events in the clubhouse were great as well; pool parties and free food.",

It was so nice to each have our own bathrooms inside our rooms and not having to furnish an entire apartment was such a relief! Its also wonderful not having to worry about overage charges for utilities. The staff at Village Green has always been super helpful and are willing to work with residents in need of assistance. In my opinion, Village Green is the perfect living arrangement for students!",

They literally forgot to clean and paint his apartment. I cleaned his room and kitchen and maintenance did his roommates rooms since they had not yet arrived. Never got paint or his carpet cleaned because the bed had been delivered. Both microwave and washing machine were broken. I had to call several times to finally get the part for the washing machine. The bus to NCSU was broken down on many occasions leaving kids to find their own transportation to class. The entire complex does not feel safe. I was happy to move him out!!!  Look elsewhere.",

It is apparent that each student matters.....each receiving individual attention, detailed grouping arrangements, genuine concern for all personal matters, as well as a friendly face and disposition whenever there is a need.  As a parent, I know that my child is in a secure and super clean environment with all the comforts of home and more.  Transportation to and from the University is even personalized.......I could not be more pleased.  Thank you Village Green for making this most important transition in our lives the best we could ever hope for......your team is the best!!!!!!!!",

Parking is not great and the walls are pretty thin, but thats to be expected with most student apartment complexes in Raleigh.  Overall I have had a good experience living here!",

        "Review": "While all of the hotel employees were especially nice and helpful, the hotel was overall in disarray. When we arrived there were no parking spaces around the hotel and we had to park at another hotel up the street. The most notable issue was the bad smell in both the second floor hallway and the stairwell, both of which smelled like a mixture of overused cleaning supplies and vomit for our entire stay.\\n\\nThe room as a whole was less than the quality we expected from *any* hotel. The carpet was covered in dark stains. Lights were burnt out in the bathroom. The tile around the toilet was cracked and grimy. The shower head was covered in stains and rust. The shower curtain rod was busted off of the wall and falling. There was hair (long, not ours) on the shower curtain and on the ceiling. The room door wouldnt open every other time we swiped our key card. I took photographs of all of these issues and would be happy to provide evidence if necessary. Overall the room looked and felt cheaply put together.\\n\\nFor $171 per night with tax, we were expecting that we would enjoy a nice vacation away from our small apartment in the Triangle in a nice hotel. Instead we found that our apartment complex offers better amenities, cleaner grounds and spaces, and we were ready to go home by our last night. Even the nice amenities that the hotel did provide, like cookies and coffee by the door, were poorly executed with a crumby table and cold coffee.",

The setting is nice but its usually loud and crowded which makes it difficult to hear your name called while you wait with a ton of other people for your coffee. The drinks are exorbitantly expensive (I go with coworkers sometimes and usually get an iced vanilla latte with almond milk and its over $6 with tax and tip) and theyre really not that good. My latte is usually crammed with fake tasting vanilla syrup and bitter burnt tasting espresso that all settles at the bottom because they dont stir it at all. To top it off, the line is super slow because 9 times out of 10 if you go during the day they have one person behind the counter taking orders, making drinks, and cleaning up.\\n\\nI would recommend trying Sosta across the street. The owner is there daily helping prepare drinks, the drinks are way cheaper than Sir Walter, and everything tastes much better.",

Windows 10 has anti-virus software built in.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, they charged her $20 Logitech wireless keyboard and then didn\\u2019t put it in the package with the new computer. They also included some random computer plug that belonged to a Dell computer, not her HP.

The sanitation score has been 92 or lower every time Ive visited for the last few years, and it shows. The counters and restaurant are consistently dirty. They bring the white sauce out in a crusty plastic pitcher. The food is not good. Last night our rice was dry and over cooked and broccoli was severely undercooked. The chicken was cooked for so long it was barely edible, like leather. And to top it all off, the food is way too expensive for the amount of food they give you. Overall incredibly disappointing and continually going downhill.",

The store layout makes it nearly impossible to find what you need or get around the massive crowds of people (the baked goods are in a case directly where people line up at the registers).

We have experienced some difficulties during the time that we have lived here but the majority of them have been things that were fixed over time as management improved or typical difficulties that you would expect to experience at any shared living complex.\\n\\nIn the last few months since my original review (which was admittedly written in irritation at a situation that was occurring at the time), things have improved. We haven\\u2019t experienced any issues since that time and have seen improvement. The management has been active in communicating with residents about upcoming changes and events. They have also been sending out surveys asking about adding new features that other complexes in the area offer, which is a good indication that they are thinking about the future and planning to compete with the newer student complexes. I appreciate this effort and everything that Brandon and Hailie and the other employees are doing.\\n\\nFor the location Village Green has excellent prices. You have easy access to I-440 in either direction, a quick drive to a full grocery store and a few shops, and it\\u2019s only 10 minutes straight down Lake Wheeler to downtown. There are a few parks and greenways nearby that I like to walk on as well.\\n\\nI would recommend this complex to students who are living in an apartment for the first time who need the essentials and quick access to their campus and who don\\u2019t mind typical amenities and appliances (what is here is good and useful, but not *high-end* like at other complexes). Come in with a positive attitude and a willingness to get to know the community and you will enjoy your time here.",

Rent is pretty cheap , however to get cable and internet you have to buy your own router. Plus an adapter cable to get cable . You would think that\\u2019s what the $150 for amnesties is for. Also, I\\u2019ve done seen two roaches in my apartment within the same week. I\\u2019m not feeling it anymore but can\\u2019t move till my lease is up .. Don\\u2019t live here the front office people are rude ! My toilet is leaking but no cares! I\\u2019ll never live here  If I could give no stars I WOULD!!!!",

I had a family emergency where I couldn\\u2019t fulfill the lease and tried to cancel it 3 weeks prior before it even started. The management/staff decided not to understand my hardship and left me high and dry . The management is very rude and Hallie has a nasty attitude . Also , if you\\u2019re not sure that this complex is where you want to stay don\\u2019t sign the lease . They are making me pay a huge bill and I\\u2019m not even moving in due to a family emergency . They say they are here to help but no one has helped me . I\\u2019ve left messages and emails and have got no replies . Plus , my friend live here and saying everything is terrible . I wish I would\\u2019ve read the reviews and all the fine print in the lease before signing . This complex wants nothing but your money . Save yourself the hassle and live somewhere else .",

She is very helpful and understanding. She helps me with just about everything and replies to her email very quickly. I dont think I have any complaints about Villiage Green. I think its the best place for students near Raleigh to live. Not only that, but the maintenance is incredible. I put in a service request not too long ago about the dishwasher and Travis was there to help in less than an hour and fixed it in 20 minutes. Overall, I love Villiage Green and Im certainly enjoying my time here!",

They are also infinitely unhelpful at solving the numerous problems that they cause. Their apartments are dangerous and the property is host to myriad of illegal activities. My apartment is completely unlivable, and they have been zero help in solving any of my problems. When I asked for the number to their corporate office they refused to give it to me, their customer service is the worst I\\u2019ve encountered. You can tell that when you have a problem their goal is not to solve it, but you get you out of the office as soon as possible to they can go back to twiddling their thumbs or whatever they do instead of making their property a welcoming, safe, or even inhabitable place to live. DO NOT SIGN A LEASE AT CAMPUS CROSSING! They WILL trap you and you will be stuck washing your money down the toilet, paying for an apartment that you are unable to even stay at. Signing a lease at Campus Crossing was the BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!! If I could give them negative 20 stars I would.",

Glen was fantastic from the initial consultation where he walked us through what to expect, to the moment we signed on the dotted line. He has a true passion for helping people find and purchase their dream home. He is a skilled and patient teacher, a prompt and diligent worker, and an advocate and fighter.\\n\\nI found his initial consultation super helpful in understanding how the buying process works. He also asked us the right questions to help him get a clear picture of our preferences in a home. He set up tours of homes and got the ball rolling quickly!\\n\\nOur process was unique in that we put an offer on the very first home we toured in a very competitive neighborhood. We were all on the same page and knew that we needed to move rapidly. So when we told Glen we wanted to put an in an offer, he was off to the races! He helped us put together a compelling and responsible offer within just a couple of hours.\\n\\nWhen the sellers eventually chose us, he helped us through everything from setting up inspections to negotiating with the seller. I found the process to be incredibly smooth and easy with him being our advocate. He checked in frequently and responded to questions promptly. He was really on top of things and did everything he needed to make sure that we closed in just a little over 3 weeks.\\n\\nHe genuinely shared in our excitement to get our first home. He celebrated with us when we went under contract and cheered us on when we got the keys. That in itself made us so pleased to work with Glen. I have no doubts that you will be as happy working with Glen as we were.",

I graduated and moved out in May of 2016 and received a MOVE OUT BILL yesterday... TWO YEARS LATER folks 2018).   The sad part is, it didn\\u2019t even take me by surprise.  However, it continues to make me LIVID.  When I called to speak with the management, there was no logical reasoning besides the fact they were looking at what the previous property manager had done wrong so they were now sending out bills to everyone to compensate.  Again, TWO YEARS LATER.  The bus that take you to and from the complex was always broken down.  I was moved out of my room 4 months before graduation into another apartment because on of my roommates was leaving and they needed the 3 bedroom apartment to house another group coming in.  The apartment I was moved to was completely covered in the other tenants dog\\u2019s hair with ants everywhere.  I also never received my refundable deposit after fighting tooth and nail for it. If you read reviews, please take into consideration finding somewhere else to live.  I promise it will make your college experience so much better and save you from feeling pure anger towards the lack of care you should receive when you pay $623 a month to just live.  And Village Green, I do not need a comment that states I may comment or email you if I have further questions.  It was very clear you guys are all about money rather than service from our phone call yesterday.",

He is easy to pay (Venmo, cash app, Apple Pay, pay pal, credit card) I will recommend him to anyone.",

        "Review": "Village Green Apartments is hardly luxury student housing.  The location is good as well as the size of the units, but working with the staff and maintenance far outweigh these positives.\\n\\nSince I have been living here, I have realized the maintenance nor management does not care about the upkeep of this place.  When I first moved in, my apartment was hardly cleaned.  My father had to drag maintenance in to actually clean it and get the management to bring in its contracted cleaners.  I cleaned the whole place myself and took pictures of everything that was damaged or unclean.  Secondly, maintenance does not respond in a timely manner.  Often, I will put in service requests that werent tended to for a week later or more.  This included emergencies.  They have an emergency line, but no one is ever on call to take those calls, nor do they call you back.  It took me 5 service requests to finally get a short circuit in my dishwasher fixed after I had told them that the circuit breaker was not the solution.  I had an ant problem in my kitchen that wasnt tended to for a week, so I bought my own raid to attempt to solve the problem.  Pest control left a note over a week later, but I am still finding traces of dead ants in my kitchen and microwave.\\n\\nAlso when I first moved in there was mold underneath my countertop near the dishwasher.  This wasnt handled for 2 months straight even though I complained, emailed, took pictures, and was stern with the office staff in person about it.  Apparently, maintenance did come in to treat it later, but they never left a note, so for a while I was still angry not even knowing they had came in.  A simple not could have stopped this.\\n\\nAnother bad part is the security.  The left exit gate is ALWAYS open.  Sure way to get a car broken into or have unsavory guests.  The worse part is that we supposedly have security, and I have seen the security guy walking around at night (havent seen him for a few months though) and I asked for his number but he said he couldnt give me one.  He said that security doesnt have a number.  So I decided to ask the leasing office and they said that they didnt know the number.  So now I dont know if he was actually security or just a guy in a security suit walking around.  Either way, there is no real security here.\\n\\nNo one cleans up trash around here.  Since the place is full of undergraduates, they party a lot and are pretty sloppy with their belongings.  The other day there was a broken trash bag in the street and 4 broken glasses.  This happened on Saturday, today is Wednesday and it still hasnt been cleaned up.  Unfortunately, this poses a threat to all the cars in the complex, so when I told the leasing office on Monday about this, they still have not done a thing.  I emailed about it Tuesday night.  Now, I have low tire pressure and I can only surmise that it may be because of the glass in the street that has been dragged all across the street because people are deciding to drive over it.  Every other week I find trash outside my door and I dont know why.  I throw it away because I dont want pests or ants.\\n\\nRecently, maintenance has been repainting and cleaning the common area and my roommates old room to get ready for a new tenant.  Every time they clean, they do not move the furniture back.\\n\\nFor the life of me I cannot understand why maintenance and management is so lazy.  It is unfortunate that this is the case because the apartments themselves really arent that bad.  A few things are poorly constructed, but its still livable.  I think when I first moved here it was the worst (Fall 2015) but in Spring 2016 it got better, however this summer it has gone back down in the dumps.  Every time I talk to a person in the office about my problems, they seem to be concerned, but they also dont do much about it.  Im not sure if there is a miscommunication, bad management, or a bad contractor, but for some reason, things are not getting done.  It makes it a very tough place to live if you have any type of routine problem that requires maintenance.",

I would recommend this place to anyone, and am surprised that it has gotten such terrible reviews. Management is so nice and really easy to work with. There is always parking for residents and normally visitor parking isnt an issue once you figure out how things work (which doesnt take long). The walls do seem to be thin, but this is an issue with any apartment complex, and really is not a big deal. The rooms are much bigger than some other apartments I have seen. The internet can be slow at times but this is not too big of a problem. I would say this place is underpriced (this being a good thing). The value is so great, yet it has cheaper rent than some other apartments of lesser value in the area. Overall, I have had a great experience living here.",

I was told initially that the repair shouldnt take more than 4 business days, but it ended up taking 7 for the entire job. Normally this would have been fine, as I had a pretty big problem with my car, but they repeatedly assured me of a date, only to change it, without notice, on that same date. One piece of advice: call daily to check on the status of the repair. In spite of this one issue, I would recommend the service at Leith Mitsubishi, and will continue to use them for future repairs. For the most part, I was in contact with Shawn Davis, and he was very nice and seemed to be committed to helping me get the best deal possible. Being a college student, this was very reassuring. Once again, I recommend this dealership and would expect nothing less than a good repair.",

He was very helpful in explaining the car features in a quick and easy way so I understood how everything functioned, while not sitting there forever.\\n\\nId also like to personally thank David Jackson for making signing the paperwork easy and painless. Ive had awful experiences buying cars (especially with trying to sell extended warranties) many times and he made the process so easy that I was genuinely shocked. The last time Id done this, the dealership held us for hours. I was done signing in little to no time at all here and was out within roughly an hour.\\n\\nThe staff were also wearing masks and for the ones that briefly took it off (in their individual office/back corner/whatever) when they saw me with a mask, they put their masks on out of respect for the customer.

The breakfast is delicious and well made plus way different every day. The kindest people run it and I highly recommend it for anyone taking a trip or honeymoon or anything. Believe me it is well worth the price you pay for the rooms. Great pool and lounging furniture as well. Cannot recommend this place enough.",

Management kept finding reasons to charge me for random things and I only stayed there for 10 weeks. The room was suppose to be cleaned prior to my moving in, but when I got there mold was growing all over the bathroom toilet, sink, and shower, plus the individual fridge had food left in it. The lock to my room also never worked and I put in an order for it to be fixed and they never fixed it, so I couldnt lock my room. Also, the amenities were not great. The pool was always being closed for renovations/cleaning and the gym equipment never worked. Additionally, people didnt follow the non-smoking rules. The only beneficial thing about this place is that it is close to Centennial Campus of NCSU, otherwise you could find so much better for a better price.",

Shes made a lot of necessary improvements and have big plans for even better improvements. My only request... please bring back Free Food Fridays thank you! Lol",

Three different times within the past year I have submitted maintenance requests, to have the maintenance man come look at the problem, say he would come back, and never show again while logging the job as complete. After graduation I moved out of my apartment and came back two months later for a final cleaning to find the apartment infested with mice. Poop everywhere, even a nest underneath my bed. Informed the management of the problem, and and a month later my roomate called to say the problem had only gotten worse. Poor service, high rates, MICE, and overall lack of quality sum up Village Green.",

There are not enough parking spots - there are 468 bedrooms here and only 395 parking spots for residents and 24 visitor spots.  Every night people end up parking on the curb because there arent enough spots and sometimes get towed. Other student apartments have multiple buses running to and from campus.  Village green only has one bus and there are gaps in the middle of the bus schedule during the day.  The pool looks nice, but it ends up being closed multiple times a summer because people break glass in it.  There are a good amount of loud parties with people shouting outside and leaving broken glass in the parking lot, on the sidewalks, and on the stairs. While the location may be convenient, the noise is not worth it for me.",
