I got my nails done this same day at my 10 am appointment. I did not finish at the salon until after 12:15... over 2 hours later with this manicure that did not even last me the rest of the day. It started chipping about 3 hours later. I got SNS and then waited over 30 minutes for this flame design which took 30 minutes to finish and had to ask someone to add a top coat to my manicure so I could leave and pay.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a real complaint since the day my roommate and I moved in.

The office staff are amazing and are always willing to work with you. They often have free food and do resident appreciation weeks.\n\nThe two-bedroom apartments are spacious, have a good amount of storage space, and they are working on putting in new furniture. Every maintenance request has always been taken care of in a timely manner, sometimes so quickly as to be surprising. Village Green is located very conveniently right off of I-440. It\u2019s a ten minute straight shot to downtown, or ten minutes to NCSU\u2019s main campus. As an NC State student, there really is no better location for the price. I\u2019ve always known it to be a quiet complex and I have never felt unsafe.\n\nMy one, and only one, complaint is the lack of visitor parking. Most visitors end up parking in the regular spots anyway and it causes issues sometimes with residents having to park two or three buildings down from their own apartment.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this complex for students who don\u2019t need \u201cluxury\u201d apartments.

I went without a washing machine for about two weeks before they could get the problem fixed. Not to mention the infestation of COCKROACHES that i dealt with on a weekly basis. They have a wonderful pool that might be open 3 weeks out of the summer due to their improper ways of enforcing their no glass policy. I moved out with all intentions of never seeing this place again but, OH NO! I just got an email threatening to send me to collections so I called back to ask what I had done. They billed me for an additional cleaning charge after I already cleaned my apartment. I told them that I had cleaned my room and asked they drop the charge. They said no, unless I had pictures to justify my case. Of all the places that I have lived in the past few years I have never had to take pictures to prove myself to be honest.

We have experienced some difficulties during the time that we have lived here but the majority of them have been things that were fixed over time as management improved or typical difficulties that you would expect to experience at any shared living complex.\n\nIn the last few months since my original review (which was admittedly written in irritation at a situation that was occurring at the time), things have improved. We haven\u2019t experienced any issues since that time and have seen improvement. The management has been active in communicating with residents about upcoming changes and events. They have also been sending out surveys asking about adding new features that other complexes in the area offer, which is a good indication that they are thinking about the future and planning to compete with the newer student complexes. I appreciate this effort and everything that Brandon and Hailie and the other employees are doing.\n\nFor the location Village Green has excellent prices. You have easy access to I-440 in either direction, a quick drive to a full grocery store and a few shops, and it\u2019s only 10 minutes straight down Lake Wheeler to downtown. There are a few parks and greenways nearby that I like to walk on as well.\n\nI would recommend this complex to students who are living in an apartment for the first time who need the essentials and quick access to their campus and who don\u2019t mind typical amenities and appliances (what is here is good and useful, but not *high-end* like at other complexes).

When I asked for the number to their corporate office they refused to give it to me, their customer service is the worst I\u2019ve encountered. You can tell that when you have a problem their goal is not to solve it, but you get you out of the office as soon as possible to they can go back to twiddling their thumbs or whatever they do instead of making their property a welcoming, safe, or even inhabitable place to live.

He also asked us the right questions to help him get a clear picture of our preferences in a home. He set up tours of homes and got the ball rolling quickly!\n\nOur process was unique in that we put an offer on the very first home we toured in a very competitive neighborhood. We were all on the same page and knew that we needed to move rapidly. So when we told Glen we wanted to put an in an offer, he was off to the races! He helped us put together a compelling and responsible offer within just a couple of hours.\n\nWhen the sellers eventually chose us, he helped us through everything from setting up inspections to negotiating with the seller. I found the process to be incredibly smooth and easy with him being our advocate. He checked in frequently and responded to questions promptly. He was really on top of things and did everything he needed to make sure that we closed in just a little over 3 weeks.\n\nHe genuinely shared in our excitement to get our first home. He celebrated with us when we went under contract and cheered us on when we got the keys. That in itself made us so pleased to work with Glen.

The sad part is, it didn\u2019t even take me by surprise.  However, it continues to make me LIVID.  When I called to speak with the management, there was no logical reasoning besides the fact they were looking at what the previous property manager had done wrong so they were now sending out bills to everyone to compensate.  Again, TWO YEARS LATER.  The bus that take you to and from the complex was always broken down.  I was moved out of my room 4 months before graduation into another apartment because on of my roommates was leaving and they needed the 3 bedroom apartment to house another group coming in.  The apartment I was moved to was completely covered in the other tenants dog\u2019s hair with ants everywhere.  I also never received my refundable deposit after fighting tooth and nail for it.

The location is good as well as the size of the units, but working with the staff and maintenance far outweigh these positives.\n\nSince I have been living here, I have realized the maintenance nor management does not care about the upkeep of this place.  When I first moved in, my apartment was hardly cleaned.  My father had to drag maintenance in to actually clean it and get the management to bring in its contracted cleaners.  I cleaned the whole place myself and took pictures of everything that was damaged or unclean.  Secondly, maintenance does not respond in a timely manner.  Often, I will put in service requests that weren't tended to for a week later or more.  This included emergencies.  They have an emergency line, but no one is ever on call to take those calls, nor do they call you back.  It took me 5 service requests to finally get a short circuit in my dishwasher fixed after I had told them that the circuit breaker was not the solution.  I had an ant problem in my kitchen that wasn't tended to for a week, so I bought my own raid to attempt to solve the problem.  Pest control left a note over a week later, but I am still finding traces of dead ants in my kitchen and microwave.\n\nAlso when I first moved in there was mold underneath my countertop near the dishwasher.  This wasn't handled for 2 months straight even though I complained, emailed, took pictures, and was stern with the office staff in person about it.  Apparently, maintenance did come in to treat it later, but they never left a note, so for a while I was still angry not even knowing they had came in.  A simple not could have stopped this.\n\nAnother bad part is the security.  The left exit gate is ALWAYS open.  Sure way to get a car broken into or have unsavory guests.  The worse part is that we supposedly have security, and I have seen the security guy walking around at night (haven't seen him for a few months though) and I asked for his number but he said he couldn't give me one.  He said that security doesn't have a number.  So I decided to ask the leasing office and they said that they didn't know the number.  So now I don't know if he was actually security or just a guy in a security suit walking around.  Either way, there is no real security here.\n\nNo one cleans up trash around here.  Since the place is full of undergraduates, they party a lot and are pretty sloppy with their belongings.  The other day there was a broken trash bag in the street and 4 broken glasses.  This happened on Saturday, today is Wednesday and it still hasn't been cleaned up.  Unfortunately, this poses a threat to all the cars in the complex, so when I told the leasing office on Monday about this, they still have not done a thing.  I emailed about it Tuesday night.  Now, I have low tire pressure and I can only surmise that it may be because of the glass in the street that has been dragged all across the street because people are deciding to drive over it.  Every other week I find trash outside my door and I don't know why.  I throw it away because I don't want pests or ants.\n\nRecently, maintenance has been repainting and cleaning the common area and my roommates old room to get ready for a new tenant.  Every time they clean, they do not move the furniture back.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot understand why maintenance and management is so lazy.  It is unfortunate that this is the case because the apartments themselves really aren't that bad.  A few things are poorly constructed, but its still livable.  I think when I first moved here it was the worst (Fall 2015) but in Spring 2016 it got better, however this summer it has gone back down in the dumps.  Every time I talk to a person in the office about my problems, they seem to be concerned, but they also don't do much about it.  I'm not sure if there is a miscommunication, bad management, or a bad contractor, but for some reason, things are not getting done.  It makes it a very tough place to live if you have any type of routine problem that requires maintenance.", "Rating": 1, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "116125232315720432741", "Review": "Nice community....it's close to downtown and to campus...cant complain...", "Rating": 4, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "103015168294831782509", "Review": "Nice apartments. also if anything goes wrong travis will be there to fix it asap!!!", "Rating": 4, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "101546487155594946192", "Review": "They do not tell you about hidden fee's , they just hit you with them.

Below I'll list the main problems we've had along with a brief description of each of them (also, see attached image of window mold due to leaking windows).  I asked for a month of rent compensation since this has been such an inconvenience especially given that I work from home and all they say they can do is compensate us for the food loss due to the fridge breaking repeatedly.\n\nMAINTENANCE ISSUES:\n1.\tWater Heater\nWater heater broke and we were out of hot water for a couple days.  Removing the heater spilled rusty water everywhere which caused us to then have a carpet cleaning company come out to remove the stains.\n\n2.\tFridge Too Cold\nThe fridge was too cold which froze and ruined all of our fruits and vegetables.  Whirlpool was supposed to come out to fix it but they no-showed.  We made a second appointment and then they came the second time to replace the thermostat and that did not resolve the issue.  We lost even more groceries after that because we thought the problem was fixed.  After 3-4 weeks of dealing with this we gave up on trying to get it fixed and we were not able to buy a lot of types of food.\n\n3.\tFridge Broke\nFinally, the fridge completely broke.  It took over 4-days to get a new fridge and nearly everything in both the fridge and freezer spoiled.\n\n4.\tKitchen Sink\nWhen we moved into the apartment the kitchen sink faucet filter was clogged which caused unusably low water pressure.\n\n5.\tFront Door Lock\nWhen we moved in we received 2 keys.  My wife's key does not work properly and she can't get into the apartment most of the time which has led to us having to frequently leave the apartment unlocked.  We have asked to have this fixed twice and it still is not. (UPDATE: they came and fixed it yesterday).\n\n6.\tWeather Stripping\nThe weather stripping on the front door isn't properly installed which has left a large gap that is big enough that you can visibly see outside from.  You can feel the cold air blow in from outside, which means we are losing significant amounts of heat and AC and have been paying elevated electric costs for the past 8-months.\n\n7.\tBugs\nThe weather stripping issue with the front door has allowed bugs to come into the apartment.  We have found both carpet beetles and silverfish because of this.  The exterminator was supposed to come but they did not call ahead and so we weren't home to unlock the door.\n\n8.\tDish Washer\nThe dishwasher broke and after maintenance came the first time to fix it it still wouldn't drain which led to them needing to come out a second time.  We were without a dishwasher for the first month we lived here.\n\n9.\tPorch Light\nThe porch light was broken when we moved in and took 2 visits by maintenance to get it fixed.\n\n10.\tWindow Mold\nThe windows leak excessively which has led to quite a bit of black mold growing around all the windows. When it rains it leaks enough that it soaks the floors and is likely causing mold to grow under the carpet.\n\n11.\tMicrowave\nThe microwave light went out.  This led to at least 3 visits by maintenance and 1 no-show appointment by Whirlpool.  When maintenance replaced the light the light would not turn off and it took almost 2-weeks before maintenance ended up replacing the whole microwave.\n\n12.\tScreen Door\nThe screen door was off its track when we moved in.\n\n13.\tShower Drain\nMaster shower drain would not drain.\n\n14.\tOffice Door\nThe office room door still will not shut and latch.\n\n15.\tIce Maker\nWhen we moved in the water wasn't turned on to the fridge so we didn't have ice for a while.  This led to another visit from maintenance to get that fixed.\n\nIf I felt they were being more reasonable with regards to resolving this issues we've had I would leave a much higher review, because like I said, I really like the place.

Went to this location twice and had the same waitress both times while sitting in the sushi bar.

She never apologized and didn\u2019t attempt to rush our other food so we couldn\u2019t all eat together, not a big deal but annoying. This second visit, one of our hibachi meals did not come out, it was clear she had miscounted and never put the order in and didn\u2019t realize it until she realized I did not have my food. She said she was going back to the kitchen to tell them they needed to make it now. Keep in mind, it had be 45+ minutes since we ordered and now I was left to wait another 20 minutes for my meal while the others in my party were hesitantly eating to avoid it not getting cold. No one ever brought any sauces and when we asked for some they brought us two salad bowls full of white and ginger sauce, very odd. After complaining to the manager and the waitress they FINALLY brought me my meal and we said that we expected this to be taken off the bill and the manger replied \u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t expect it, but it will be\u201d in the most hateful and disrespectful tone. There was never an apology, horrible customer service, and just overall a lack of effort. The manager\u2019s name was Adrian and I wish I had the waitresses name, but she does wear glasses so if you do somehow decide to go to this location and sit in the sushi area, DO NOT get a waitress wearing glasses and a smug look on her face.

These expectations were not met.\n\nFor starters, the beach is a walk across the street from the resort, which is fine, but not really what I expected.  After you walk to the beach, you will find that the Henderson has a very thin private beach.  On that thin beach, there are hundreds of chairs squeezed together like sardines.  Which BTW, they will charge you $45-$60 a day to rent.  I would find that charge acceptable if you were staying at a no frills hotel, but when you are paying $500+ a night plus a $35 resort fee (which doesn\u2019t really cover anything that any other hotel would cover without a resort fee), you really don\u2019t expect to be nickel and dimed like that.\n\nEverything at the resort (food, drinks, etc) is priced high which is to be expected at a high end hotel.  However, the level of service provided is pretty poor.  This morning at their restaurant Primrose, we waited 20 minutes for any server to acknowledge our presence.  None did until I asked who our server was.  I ordered the buffet which pitched made to order omelets.  I stood at the buffet for 10 minutes waiting for anyone to actually walk out and make an omelette.   The food itself was just OK.  Basically what you would expect at any generic Marriott or Hilton but you are paying high end prices.\n\nI was really excited to find what I thought would be a 5 star resort at one of my favorite beaches.  However,  I won\u2019t be visiting again.   The property itself is nice and the pools are pretty good.  It just doesn\u2019t have the amenities, level of service or just overall experience that you would expect at this price point.", "Rating": 3, "Location": {"Name": "The Henderson Beach Resort & Spa", "Address": "200 Henderson Resort Way, Destin, FL 32541", "Tags": ["Resort hotel", "Restaurant", "Spa"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "115591214427381986046", "Review": "This is a must visit when you are at Lake Martin.

Never spoke to the women that day. Now we\u2019re 2 to 3 days later with no phone call. I called back and left another message for her to give me a call. She calls back went over everything she states that she had to run my credit and I ask well if I was already approved up to a certain amount why do you have to run my credit again and she says that she has to submit an application for the additional funds I\u2019m like well if I was already approved why would I have to submit another application neither here or there I let her run my credit for another application she said she\u2019s gonna call me within 30 minutes 30 minutes go by never hear from her.

Through a series of testing with a multimeter I found the alternator had gone bad. Purchased a new one from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s in Wake Forest. The new alternator seemed to be working fine when paired with a 1 year old battery.  A few days ago similar electrical problems started to occur so I told my wife to visit the same O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. An employee there named Charles figured the battery had gone bad and recommended replacing it. This was logical and sound thinking since the alternator had been replaced only months ago. However, Charles did not test the battery before replacing it. The next day the same electrical issues occur. I came home and found that the 3 month old alternator had gone bad. I returned the alternator to Oriely\u2019s and requested the warranty be honored for a new alternator and I wanted my old battery back in exchange for the new one we had purchased. The manager on site, Joe, said my battery had been shipped out and he would need to speak with Charles before refunding me for the battery. A brand new alternator was provided in exchange for the bad one. The next day, a few phone calls later, Joe said he would be more than happy to refund me for the battery and I could keep the new battery since my old one had gone bad due to the 3 month old bad alternator. My old battery had been tested AFTER the exchange for a new battery and did show that it had a bad cell.\n\nAt the end of the day, Joe the manager, fellow management, and staff were excellent. I was extremely happy with Joe\u2019s customer service, quick clear communication, and willingness to handle conflict on an even playing field. I highly respect him for how he handled the situation and appreciate his willingness to keep an open mind.\n\nHowever, Charles was very rude and spoke with disgust when my wife returned to receive her refund for the battery. Charles is knowledgable and willing to help but seems to struggle to contain his emotions when faced with conflict.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s is a fantastic auto parts distributor and deserves 5 stars.

I also ordered their buffalo chicken empanada and the pork/pineapple empanada. Both were ok. The shell was amazing but the fillings were just ok. The buffalo chicken had grease pouring out after I took a bite and wasn't too flavorable. The pork/pineapple was on the bland side with the occasional sweetness of the pineapple. I'm a sauce person and love just about everything out there but the sauce they give with your empanadas wasn't very good. I ended up just eating my empanadas by themselves.\n\nI would possibly go back to try another sandwich with a soup and maybe their s'more empanada.

We go several times a year. Every time we go we have a great time! If you show up when they open at 9 everything is ride now! Even if we show up later in the day around 12 we can still usually get 5 or 6 rides in without even trying. That is excluding the lazy rivers and wave pool.\n\nWe are often puzzled by other reviews that say there aren't any seats available. Every time we have gone there are seats everywhere. They may not be under an umbrella or shelter but there are always seats available.\nNow the Fearless River. At it's deepest point the water can be overwhelming in the section where the bottom feels like rolling hills. However if you are required to wear a life vest this should cause you to think if you're not a good swimmer.  None of the other rides require a life vest. Just something to think about. Otherwise it's a great ride.\nThe park has many interactive points that you activate with your Tapu Tapu \"the watch thing\". From spraying people to getting gusts of air, live interaction with the holographic face in the mountain and even a water gun there are many fun things to activate with the Tapu Tapu.\nThe Tapu Tapu also can be used to open lockers, pay for anything even alcohol at the bars and review all the pictures taken of you on each ride. You can purchase what ever pictures you like.\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful. I find that if you treat people with respect you get the same in return. If you demand to be treated like royalty because you paid $2000 for your trip, get in line so did everyone else.

I took my veiled chameleon, who I\u2019ve had for 3 months to get antibiotics for what I thought was an upper respiratory infection. He had gone 4-5 days without eating anything. Which is one to two days more than what is concerning. He has gone 3 days without eating before. Most chameleons do. However, we offer food daily. They informed me that they were backed up with a lot of surgeries and appointments, but because of my anxiety, and want for him to be seen, I was told I could pay $116 instead of $70 and they would see him. If I could go back, I would have never taken him. I probably would have found somebody else. Everything was what I considered \u201ctypical\u201d,  but obviously so I thought. I waited in the car while they took care of Mike Wazowski. This is the policy they have in place because of COVID, I assume. Let me mention this was also my first visit here. Directly after dropping him off, I received a call from Dr. Locke, who asked me about his setup, lights, vitamins, etc. & then she told me Mike Wazowski had pneumonia, not a URI. She informed she would be giving an antibiotic with fluids and vitamins, since he had not eaten, and that it would only be about 20 minutes. An hour later, her technician calls me to pick up. When I spoke to both the technician & vet, neither mentioned anything about my chameleon being in critical condition. She told me what I was being sent home with, what to do & even added that my chameleon had \u201cdone so good!\u201d There was not even a suggestion to put him in a hospital box, to protect him from falling. So when I got back home, I put him back in his cage. His entire side had turned black from where he was injected, which can be normal, but I was concerned because it had started to cover his entire side, not just at the one spot of injection. There had also been blood dripping from the bottom of his mouth/out of his nostrils from the moment we left. A few moments later, when I check on him, he had fallen and was on the bottom of his cage. Looking back now, I realize this was the moment he was actually dying. I laid him in a hospital box and shortly after he finished passing. During all of this, I had called the vets office, but they were about to close so they kept telling me to wait & if it gets any worse to call another clinic, once they shut. I know I was saying \u201cI think he\u2019s going to pass. After begging three separate times for the notes from my visit, I received it AFTER his death, at 6:34pm. Which is after the office supposedly \u201cshuts\u201d. This was after I was able to speak to Dr. Locke again, where she told me the bleeding was \u201cnormal\u201d & that he had in fact been in \u201ccritical condition\u201d. She told me she would send the notes right away. Received them an hour later. She also said I could be refunded for the fecal cup that they sent me home with to test his poop, but could not refund me for the medicine or anything else because it was opened. When I spoke to the supervisor today, to get a refund for the $300 total I spent, she immediately got defensive and told me that she was there when Mike Wazowski came in. And that I was told he was in critical condition via phone and via notes. This is 100% inaccurate. I was also given medicine with an exp. date of 2016, but was told it was just a \u201cdefault\u201d in the computer and they would \u201ctalk about it\u201d. I was also told at one point that \u201cyou knew we were too busy\u201d Overall my experience and feeling that my Cham got worse after visiting, was invalidated and taken offensively by both the supervisor and doctor. They kept reminding me that they were professionals with degrees and they knew the best. After the supervisor saw I was not going to back down, she then put the doctor back on the phone. After speaking to her, she made it clear she had other patients who were critical condition and needed to be seen so the conversation was over. I honestly feel 100% disrespected and disappointed in the way this situation was handled.

The first two jobs - valve and pipe replacements were very professionally completed by experienced teams for a fair price. There were a couple challenges but they made it look routine and easy. The hot water heater replacements required some consultation as I was considering going tank-less. It seemed like the way to go but after I discussed with Gary he explained the additional labor, retrofit and unit costs, we all agreed to stay with the original configuration and save the additional money for other home improvements. I greatly appreciate his input and advise as it was a more practical solution for us. Larry and his crew did an outstanding job and on top of that we have much more hot water flow due to the \"old age\" of our previous system and the workmanship and quality of the new two hot water heaters!", "Rating": 5, "Location": {"Name": "Gary Willis Plumbing", "Address": "2820 Bailey Rd, Coats, NC 27521", "Tags": ["Plumber"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "105486624192831073829", "Review": "The human race has been responsible for many engineering marvels.

It\u2019s eclectic just like Roy. Super interesting to look around and the food is stellar. I had the pork belly rice bowl and it was so flavorful. Crisp veggies, a nice contrasting acidity with the pickled radishes. A custardy egg to top it all off. It\u2019s a rad vibe and is fun to take on melding Mexican and Korean flavors.\n\nEDIT:\nSecond time Here this week. I had the shrimp appetizer, which was good. Well cooked, spicy with a bit of tang but not my favorite. The kimchi fried rice did not disappoint one both. Flavorful and delicious, and easy to eat the entire bowl. I finished the the medjool date cake. Holy cow dude. Delicious. The cake was warm and inviting and soooo moist.

Great ambiance and decor. Sizable but usually busy too, like so many places in Vegas. A good selection of bourbon and great bacon infused manhattan. The service is pretty good post COVID, which is hard to say about a lot of places. Ordered the fried green tomatoes with pork belly. The taste was mediocre but the worst offense was how overcooked and tough the pork was, honestly a huge letdown. I would\u2019ve told my server/bartender had he asked how I enjoyed it. For an entree I had the shrimp and grits which were good, but nothing to write home about. The menu selection seems a little more limited than the last time I was there, and not many things jumped out at me. This place is great for cocktails and hanging with friends, but not too sure if I would recommend it for a great meal anymore.

It\u2019s a hole in the wall repair place that had a decent amount of used options in a variety of price ranges. The one younger Spanish guy was helpful. Then I asked if they replace compressors and started asking if it\u2019s worth it. The second older gentlemen who was the actual tech chimes in and is pretty asinine off the bat. Supposedly me doing some reading to get educated on the process and cost of replacing compressors is what set him off, claiming that everybody who reads something on the web now claims to be an expert. Most of it seemed a bit age-ist, the rest just that he was unhappy in general and felt like being argumentative. Coincidentally enough, I have replaced quite a few Evap fans, thermistors l, and done small repairs on most of my appliances over the years with the help of some service manuals. Anywho, the experience was awful. No manners, poor customer service, and just an awful human being, that experience was the only one to never go back or recommend.

For perspective I spend about 200 days a year traveling and in hotels, the majority of which happen to be Marriott the property is newish and clean. I used points to get a room about 15 mins before showing up at 5pm on a Friday. Parking was free. Checking in was relatively easy but definitely not the most personable employee. They had a pool, gym, and outdoor jacuzzi and fireplace that looked nice but we didn\u2019t have the time to enjoy. Room was great, clean, spacious enough. Had a mini fridge for your use and microwave. Bed was comfortable for me but I enjoy firmer mattresses. Bathroom was a decent size but unfortunately has that half door thing that I hate since water always gets on the floor. Two of the USB charging ports didn\u2019t work but I didn\u2019t feel like moving furniture to see that they just weren\u2019t plugged in. I honestly didn\u2019t mind this property, the only issue happened when we were leaving. My girlfriend was waiting for me to get downstairs. A man was sing at the bistro bar when I went up to the room. After 10mins he asked the girl at the counter if she was going to ask for his order. She said that they close in 5 mins when it was still 10mins to the hour. Which isn\u2019t the point since she saw him sitting there. Earlier in the day I was looking at the menu for a quick bite too and the same female worker tended to me. She wasn\u2019t asinine per say, but definitely short and a bit rude.

Attached is a sizeable gift shop and a spot that serves some light pre made snacks and beer. I believe I saw a bar upstairs too. The ticket gets you access until 9pm, with re-entry, so I could see appreciating it in the morning, exploring the town, then coming back at night. The views really are incredible, even without crossing the bridge itself. There are a ton of photo opportunities great views to be had. I loved crossing the bridge. In the center they have a huge American flag hanging, and a section of the bridge has a clear bottom so you can see below. I would caution that the bridge can sway a decent amount, and a handful of people were having a bit of a rough time crossing, food for thought.

Takeout only at the moment for your information. I always like to try the jerk chicken or oxtail at Jamaican dives since I feel those are great staples, today I went for the jerk chicken. I wanted to grab it with some shrimp like on the menu,  but the girl on the phone said they are doing the shrimp because a worker there has an allergy to it. A bit odd to still have it on the menu, but totally understandable. I value companies that care for their workers. They asked told me it came boneless, which grabbed my attention since every other time I've had jerk chicken, its been served on the bone and I think it helps keep the meat moist. Anyway, I cleared there doorway of some cleaners and paper towel that somebody left in front. Had a nice moment with the girl taking payment, while we played the NFC game thru a glass window. Anywho, got home excited since its been awhile and unfortunately didn't fulfill that hankering I had for some Caribbean grub. The chicken was dry, and white meat only, bummer. The sauce was fantastic, but it had so little on it. The rice was also a bit bland for my taste, but we all have opinions. The plantains were yummy, but I have a sweet spot for them. I'm a white dude who loves to travel and eat a lot. I haven't been to Jamaica but have been to other Caribbean islands. About 10 years ago I was doing a tour of the NYC boroughs with a Caribbean group. I was the only white dude on the crew and in every borough they had it catered by a local Caribbean restaurant. The food was always spectacular and gave me quite the appreciate for this cuisine. The slow cooked and stewed meats that are so juicy, the dry rubs that have a great balance heat and flavor, the plantains..... Anywho, I digress.

It was full on a Monday night with a hurricane only a couple hours from landing. Our party was surprised when the side salad came. I expected the typical iceberg mix from a bag (no harm if it was) but the salad was dressed with generous portions of chopped onions, bell peppers and tomatoes, shredded cheese, crispy bacon and croutons-  everyone in my party ate it all up. The buffalo and teriyaki chicken wings were cooked just right- crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and properly sauced- tasty. Then our entrees came...\"I've never had popcorn shrimp that wasn't over cooked- this is perfect!\" And, \"These may be the best fried oysters I've ever had.\" And so on from everyone. The fish was extremely fresh, good cuts, and not over cooked in old oil (you know what I'm talking about). They also fry fish separately from other fried foods. So, the next time you are in North Myrtle Beach looking for a relaxed, friendly place to eat some seafood go check out Moto's.

I was a patient at Naran Family Dentistry for several years. Over those years, my oral health worsened as a result of the treatments I received. Dr. Naran placed several amalgam (also known as mercury or silver) fillings in my teeth. At the time he assured me that these were stronger and would last longer than composite or white fillings. Due to their mercury content, amalgam fillings can expand and retract with changes of temperature which can cause incorrect bonding to the tooth and cracks in the tooth. This is what has happened to me. I have had to replace almost all of the amalgam fillings Dr. Naran gave me due to decay underneath the fillings and had to get a crown from the cracks it caused in my tooth.  I have been told by other dentists that this was due to the use of the amalgam filling material. This has cost me thousands of dollars to correct. Also I would like to note that the FDA has issued a warning that mercury fillings should not be placed in women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. As a woman who was married and planning to have children this was not taken into consideration. I would not have consented to the mercury containing fillings if I had known these risks. It is just unnecessary when there is a viable alternative of white fillings that don't have the same warnings. Overall, I wish I had never been a patient here. Dr. Naran made my longterm oral health much worse by his recommendations for my teeth. While I was a patient I was shamed by the staff for not having perfectly white teeth in an effort to sell me bleaching treatments. Besides being expensive, I believe these treatments caused my teeth to be brittle and easily chip. After leaving the practice I have worked with another dentist to restore my dental health and I now have strong resilient teeth.", "Rating": 2, "Location": {"Name": "Naran Family Dentistry", "Address": "4703 Western Blvd, Raleigh, NC 27606", "Tags": ["Dentist", "Cosmetic dentist", "Emergency dental service"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "101370385588566662685", "Review": "Decent food but their politics is insane.

We stayed in close proximity to our home for 4 nights and let me first say I think I just choose the wrong type of hotel for our needs, which is not on the hotel. This is a business traveler hotel and the climate screams autonomy, not extended stay comforts of home. They do not include breakfast and you don't have a kitchenette, but a mini fridge, small coffee maker and microwave. The room (a double queen suite) was almost the size of a regular double queen at a Hampton Inn.\nThat said the staff can help or hinder your stay. Justine made our stay pleasant and remembered our floors upon check out. Bethany, one of the Mgrs was also accommodating of our needs like moving us to a larger room, with a smile! But one male Mgr, Miguel, was so cold and uncaring when I told him how hard the mattress was after the first night, and that my back was now hurting. He told me people like their beds, and then proceeded to explain different types of mattress comfort to me. I stopped him! I asked for a mattress pad and he said was going to check, but never followed up. I called the front desk and was advised that they didn't have one. So we went out and bought a mattress pad. I slept very well the rest of my stay. Justine reimbursed us for one night to compensate for the mattress pad purchase, which we will take with us on trips now. So overall we worked together to remedy the situation. Miguel either was having a bad day, simply didn't care, or should not be in the hotel (hospitality) industry. The Miguel effect is what I remember about this place above all else.
