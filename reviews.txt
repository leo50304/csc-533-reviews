  'Review': 'I usually have had good experiences at Posh but this bad one overrides them all. I got my nails done this same day at my 10 am appointment. I did not finish at the salon until after 12:15... over 2 hours later with this manicure that did not even last me the rest of the day. It started chipping about 3 hours later. I got SNS and then waited over 30 minutes for this flame design which took 30 minutes to finish and had to ask someone to add a top coat to my manicure so I could leave and pay. Not at all worth my time or money, very disappointed. Would love to have some compensation for this as I am a returning customer.',

  'Review': 'Loving my experience at Inman parks! Azyn from the leasing office was beyond personable and helpful. My roommate and I were displaced after the VG apartment fire and Azyn worked with us quickly and efficiently under these circumstances. She helped us get moved in within 48 hours and I am in love with the place. The apartment layout is unique and so cute with great amenities! Highly recommend this community!!',
