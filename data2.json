I got my nails done this same day at my 10 am appointment. I did not finish at the salon until after 12:15... over 2 hours later with this manicure that did not even last me the rest of the day. It started chipping about 3 hours later. I got SNS and then waited over 30 minutes for this flame design which took 30 minutes to finish and had to ask someone to add a top coat to my manicure so I could leave and pay.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a real complaint since the day my roommate and I moved in.

The office staff are amazing and are always willing to work with you. They often have free food and do resident appreciation weeks.\n\nThe two-bedroom apartments are spacious, have a good amount of storage space, and they are working on putting in new furniture. Every maintenance request has always been taken care of in a timely manner, sometimes so quickly as to be surprising. Village Green is located very conveniently right off of I-440. It\u2019s a ten minute straight shot to downtown, or ten minutes to NCSU\u2019s main campus. As an NC State student, there really is no better location for the price. I\u2019ve always known it to be a quiet complex and I have never felt unsafe.\n\nMy one, and only one, complaint is the lack of visitor parking. Most visitors end up parking in the regular spots anyway and it causes issues sometimes with residents having to park two or three buildings down from their own apartment.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this complex for students who don\u2019t need \u201cluxury\u201d apartments.

I went without a washing machine for about two weeks before they could get the problem fixed. Not to mention the infestation of COCKROACHES that i dealt with on a weekly basis. They have a wonderful pool that might be open 3 weeks out of the summer due to their improper ways of enforcing their no glass policy. I moved out with all intentions of never seeing this place again but, OH NO! I just got an email threatening to send me to collections so I called back to ask what I had done. They billed me for an additional cleaning charge after I already cleaned my apartment. I told them that I had cleaned my room and asked they drop the charge. They said no, unless I had pictures to justify my case. Of all the places that I have lived in the past few years I have never had to take pictures to prove myself to be honest.

We have experienced some difficulties during the time that we have lived here but the majority of them have been things that were fixed over time as management improved or typical difficulties that you would expect to experience at any shared living complex.\n\nIn the last few months since my original review (which was admittedly written in irritation at a situation that was occurring at the time), things have improved. We haven\u2019t experienced any issues since that time and have seen improvement. The management has been active in communicating with residents about upcoming changes and events. They have also been sending out surveys asking about adding new features that other complexes in the area offer, which is a good indication that they are thinking about the future and planning to compete with the newer student complexes. I appreciate this effort and everything that Brandon and Hailie and the other employees are doing.\n\nFor the location Village Green has excellent prices. You have easy access to I-440 in either direction, a quick drive to a full grocery store and a few shops, and it\u2019s only 10 minutes straight down Lake Wheeler to downtown. There are a few parks and greenways nearby that I like to walk on as well.\n\nI would recommend this complex to students who are living in an apartment for the first time who need the essentials and quick access to their campus and who don\u2019t mind typical amenities and appliances (what is here is good and useful, but not *high-end* like at other complexes).

When I asked for the number to their corporate office they refused to give it to me, their customer service is the worst I\u2019ve encountered. You can tell that when you have a problem their goal is not to solve it, but you get you out of the office as soon as possible to they can go back to twiddling their thumbs or whatever they do instead of making their property a welcoming, safe, or even inhabitable place to live.

He also asked us the right questions to help him get a clear picture of our preferences in a home. He set up tours of homes and got the ball rolling quickly!\n\nOur process was unique in that we put an offer on the very first home we toured in a very competitive neighborhood. We were all on the same page and knew that we needed to move rapidly. So when we told Glen we wanted to put an in an offer, he was off to the races! He helped us put together a compelling and responsible offer within just a couple of hours.\n\nWhen the sellers eventually chose us, he helped us through everything from setting up inspections to negotiating with the seller. I found the process to be incredibly smooth and easy with him being our advocate. He checked in frequently and responded to questions promptly. He was really on top of things and did everything he needed to make sure that we closed in just a little over 3 weeks.\n\nHe genuinely shared in our excitement to get our first home. He celebrated with us when we went under contract and cheered us on when we got the keys. That in itself made us so pleased to work with Glen.

The sad part is, it didn\u2019t even take me by surprise.  However, it continues to make me LIVID.  When I called to speak with the management, there was no logical reasoning besides the fact they were looking at what the previous property manager had done wrong so they were now sending out bills to everyone to compensate.  Again, TWO YEARS LATER.  The bus that take you to and from the complex was always broken down.  I was moved out of my room 4 months before graduation into another apartment because on of my roommates was leaving and they needed the 3 bedroom apartment to house another group coming in.  The apartment I was moved to was completely covered in the other tenants dog\u2019s hair with ants everywhere.  I also never received my refundable deposit after fighting tooth and nail for it.

The location is good as well as the size of the units, but working with the staff and maintenance far outweigh these positives.\n\nSince I have been living here, I have realized the maintenance nor management does not care about the upkeep of this place.  When I first moved in, my apartment was hardly cleaned.  My father had to drag maintenance in to actually clean it and get the management to bring in its contracted cleaners.  I cleaned the whole place myself and took pictures of everything that was damaged or unclean.  Secondly, maintenance does not respond in a timely manner.  Often, I will put in service requests that weren't tended to for a week later or more.  This included emergencies.  They have an emergency line, but no one is ever on call to take those calls, nor do they call you back.  It took me 5 service requests to finally get a short circuit in my dishwasher fixed after I had told them that the circuit breaker was not the solution.  I had an ant problem in my kitchen that wasn't tended to for a week, so I bought my own raid to attempt to solve the problem.  Pest control left a note over a week later, but I am still finding traces of dead ants in my kitchen and microwave.\n\nAlso when I first moved in there was mold underneath my countertop near the dishwasher.  This wasn't handled for 2 months straight even though I complained, emailed, took pictures, and was stern with the office staff in person about it.  Apparently, maintenance did come in to treat it later, but they never left a note, so for a while I was still angry not even knowing they had came in.  A simple not could have stopped this.\n\nAnother bad part is the security.  The left exit gate is ALWAYS open.  Sure way to get a car broken into or have unsavory guests.  The worse part is that we supposedly have security, and I have seen the security guy walking around at night (haven't seen him for a few months though) and I asked for his number but he said he couldn't give me one.  He said that security doesn't have a number.  So I decided to ask the leasing office and they said that they didn't know the number.  So now I don't know if he was actually security or just a guy in a security suit walking around.  Either way, there is no real security here.\n\nNo one cleans up trash around here.  Since the place is full of undergraduates, they party a lot and are pretty sloppy with their belongings.  The other day there was a broken trash bag in the street and 4 broken glasses.  This happened on Saturday, today is Wednesday and it still hasn't been cleaned up.  Unfortunately, this poses a threat to all the cars in the complex, so when I told the leasing office on Monday about this, they still have not done a thing.  I emailed about it Tuesday night.  Now, I have low tire pressure and I can only surmise that it may be because of the glass in the street that has been dragged all across the street because people are deciding to drive over it.  Every other week I find trash outside my door and I don't know why.  I throw it away because I don't want pests or ants.\n\nRecently, maintenance has been repainting and cleaning the common area and my roommates old room to get ready for a new tenant.  Every time they clean, they do not move the furniture back.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot understand why maintenance and management is so lazy.  It is unfortunate that this is the case because the apartments themselves really aren't that bad.  A few things are poorly constructed, but its still livable.  I think when I first moved here it was the worst (Fall 2015) but in Spring 2016 it got better, however this summer it has gone back down in the dumps.  Every time I talk to a person in the office about my problems, they seem to be concerned, but they also don't do much about it.  I'm not sure if there is a miscommunication, bad management, or a bad contractor, but for some reason, things are not getting done.  It makes it a very tough place to live if you have any type of routine problem that requires maintenance.", "Rating": 1, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "116125232315720432741", "Review": "Nice community....it's close to downtown and to campus...cant complain...", "Rating": 4, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "103015168294831782509", "Review": "Nice apartments. also if anything goes wrong travis will be there to fix it asap!!!", "Rating": 4, "Location": {"Name": "Village Green Student Housing", "Address": "2000 Village Bluff Pl, Raleigh, NC 27603", "Tags": ["Student housing center", "Apartment building", "Apartment complex", "Apartment rental agency", "Condominium complex", "Condominium rental agency", "Real estate rental agency"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "101546487155594946192", "Review": "They do not tell you about hidden fee's , they just hit you with them.

Below I'll list the main problems we've had along with a brief description of each of them (also, see attached image of window mold due to leaking windows).  I asked for a month of rent compensation since this has been such an inconvenience especially given that I work from home and all they say they can do is compensate us for the food loss due to the fridge breaking repeatedly.\n\nMAINTENANCE ISSUES:\n1.\tWater Heater\nWater heater broke and we were out of hot water for a couple days.  Removing the heater spilled rusty water everywhere which caused us to then have a carpet cleaning company come out to remove the stains.\n\n2.\tFridge Too Cold\nThe fridge was too cold which froze and ruined all of our fruits and vegetables.  Whirlpool was supposed to come out to fix it but they no-showed.  We made a second appointment and then they came the second time to replace the thermostat and that did not resolve the issue.  We lost even more groceries after that because we thought the problem was fixed.  After 3-4 weeks of dealing with this we gave up on trying to get it fixed and we were not able to buy a lot of types of food.\n\n3.\tFridge Broke\nFinally, the fridge completely broke.  It took over 4-days to get a new fridge and nearly everything in both the fridge and freezer spoiled.\n\n4.\tKitchen Sink\nWhen we moved into the apartment the kitchen sink faucet filter was clogged which caused unusably low water pressure.\n\n5.\tFront Door Lock\nWhen we moved in we received 2 keys.  My wife's key does not work properly and she can't get into the apartment most of the time which has led to us having to frequently leave the apartment unlocked.  We have asked to have this fixed twice and it still is not. (UPDATE: they came and fixed it yesterday).\n\n6.\tWeather Stripping\nThe weather stripping on the front door isn't properly installed which has left a large gap that is big enough that you can visibly see outside from.  You can feel the cold air blow in from outside, which means we are losing significant amounts of heat and AC and have been paying elevated electric costs for the past 8-months.\n\n7.\tBugs\nThe weather stripping issue with the front door has allowed bugs to come into the apartment.  We have found both carpet beetles and silverfish because of this.  The exterminator was supposed to come but they did not call ahead and so we weren't home to unlock the door.\n\n8.\tDish Washer\nThe dishwasher broke and after maintenance came the first time to fix it it still wouldn't drain which led to them needing to come out a second time.  We were without a dishwasher for the first month we lived here.\n\n9.\tPorch Light\nThe porch light was broken when we moved in and took 2 visits by maintenance to get it fixed.\n\n10.\tWindow Mold\nThe windows leak excessively which has led to quite a bit of black mold growing around all the windows. When it rains it leaks enough that it soaks the floors and is likely causing mold to grow under the carpet.\n\n11.\tMicrowave\nThe microwave light went out.  This led to at least 3 visits by maintenance and 1 no-show appointment by Whirlpool.  When maintenance replaced the light the light would not turn off and it took almost 2-weeks before maintenance ended up replacing the whole microwave.\n\n12.\tScreen Door\nThe screen door was off its track when we moved in.\n\n13.\tShower Drain\nMaster shower drain would not drain.\n\n14.\tOffice Door\nThe office room door still will not shut and latch.\n\n15.\tIce Maker\nWhen we moved in the water wasn't turned on to the fridge so we didn't have ice for a while.  This led to another visit from maintenance to get that fixed.\n\nIf I felt they were being more reasonable with regards to resolving this issues we've had I would leave a much higher review, because like I said, I really like the place.

Went to this location twice and had the same waitress both times while sitting in the sushi bar.

She never apologized and didn\u2019t attempt to rush our other food so we couldn\u2019t all eat together, not a big deal but annoying. This second visit, one of our hibachi meals did not come out, it was clear she had miscounted and never put the order in and didn\u2019t realize it until she realized I did not have my food. She said she was going back to the kitchen to tell them they needed to make it now. Keep in mind, it had be 45+ minutes since we ordered and now I was left to wait another 20 minutes for my meal while the others in my party were hesitantly eating to avoid it not getting cold. No one ever brought any sauces and when we asked for some they brought us two salad bowls full of white and ginger sauce, very odd. After complaining to the manager and the waitress they FINALLY brought me my meal and we said that we expected this to be taken off the bill and the manger replied \u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t expect it, but it will be\u201d in the most hateful and disrespectful tone. There was never an apology, horrible customer service, and just overall a lack of effort. The manager\u2019s name was Adrian and I wish I had the waitresses name, but she does wear glasses so if you do somehow decide to go to this location and sit in the sushi area, DO NOT get a waitress wearing glasses and a smug look on her face.

These expectations were not met.\n\nFor starters, the beach is a walk across the street from the resort, which is fine, but not really what I expected.  After you walk to the beach, you will find that the Henderson has a very thin private beach.  On that thin beach, there are hundreds of chairs squeezed together like sardines.  Which BTW, they will charge you $45-$60 a day to rent.  I would find that charge acceptable if you were staying at a no frills hotel, but when you are paying $500+ a night plus a $35 resort fee (which doesn\u2019t really cover anything that any other hotel would cover without a resort fee), you really don\u2019t expect to be nickel and dimed like that.\n\nEverything at the resort (food, drinks, etc) is priced high which is to be expected at a high end hotel.  However, the level of service provided is pretty poor.  This morning at their restaurant Primrose, we waited 20 minutes for any server to acknowledge our presence.  None did until I asked who our server was.  I ordered the buffet which pitched made to order omelets.  I stood at the buffet for 10 minutes waiting for anyone to actually walk out and make an omelette.   The food itself was just OK.  Basically what you would expect at any generic Marriott or Hilton but you are paying high end prices.\n\nI was really excited to find what I thought would be a 5 star resort at one of my favorite beaches.  However,  I won\u2019t be visiting again.   The property itself is nice and the pools are pretty good.  It just doesn\u2019t have the amenities, level of service or just overall experience that you would expect at this price point.", "Rating": 3, "Location": {"Name": "The Henderson Beach Resort & Spa", "Address": "200 Henderson Resort Way, Destin, FL 32541", "Tags": ["Resort hotel", "Restaurant", "Spa"], "Cost": null}}, {"User": "115591214427381986046", "Review": "This is a must visit when you are at Lake Martin.

Never spoke to the women that day. Now we\u2019re 2 to 3 days later with no phone call. I called back and left another message for her to give me a call. She calls back went over everything she states that she had to run my credit and I ask well if I was already approved up to a certain amount why do you have to run my credit again and she says that she has to submit an application for the additional funds I\u2019m like well if I was already approved why would I have to submit another application neither here or there I let her run my credit for another application she said she\u2019s gonna call me within 30 minutes 30 minutes go by never hear from her.

Through a series of testing with a multimeter I found the alternator had gone bad. Purchased a new one from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s in Wake Forest. The new alternator seemed to be working fine when paired with a 1 year old battery.  A few days ago similar electrical problems started to occur so I told my wife to visit the same O\u2019Reilly\u2019s. An employee there named Charles figured the battery had gone bad and recommended replacing it. This was logical and sound thinking since the alternator had been replaced only months ago. However, Charles did not test the battery before replacing it. The next day the same electrical issues occur. I came home and found that the 3 month old alternator had gone bad. I returned the alternator to Oriely\u2019s and requested the warranty be honored for a new alternator and I wanted my old battery back in exchange for the new one we had purchased. The manager on site, Joe, said my battery had been shipped out and he would need to speak with Charles before refunding me for the battery. A brand new alternator was provided in exchange for the bad one. The next day, a few phone calls later, Joe said he would be more than happy to refund me for the battery and I could keep the new battery since my old one had gone bad due to the 3 month old bad alternator. My old battery had been tested AFTER the exchange for a new battery and did show that it had a bad cell.\n\nAt the end of the day, Joe the manager, fellow management, and staff were excellent. I was extremely happy with Joe\u2019s customer service, quick clear communication, and willingness to handle conflict on an even playing field. I highly respect him for how he handled the situation and appreciate his willingness to keep an open mind.\n\nHowever, Charles was very rude and spoke with disgust when my wife returned to receive her refund for the battery. Charles is knowledgable and willing to help but seems to struggle to contain his emotions when faced with conflict.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s is a fantastic auto parts distributor and deserves 5 stars.

I also ordered their buffalo chicken empanada and the pork/pineapple empanada. Both were ok. The shell was amazing but the fillings were just ok. The buffalo chicken had grease pouring out after I took a bite and wasn't too flavorable. The pork/pineapple was on the bland side with the occasional sweetness of the pineapple. I'm a sauce person and love just about everything out there but the sauce they give with your empanadas wasn't very good. I ended up just eating my empanadas by themselves.\n\nI would possibly go back to try another sandwich with a soup and maybe their s'more empanada.

I received confirmation they had gotten my response and knew we were coming. When we got to the hotel they told us we had cancelled and that we were lucky to get a room. Thankfully I had kept all emails where it was clear I had not cancelled.\n\nBasically they were going to take our money and then put the room up for renting to someone else essentially getting double payout.
